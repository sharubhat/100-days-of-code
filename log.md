# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Solved Topcoder porblem on [Circuits](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1593&rd=4494)

**Thoughts:** I should not be stressing myself to get a solution quickly. Aim is to understand both the problem and the concept correctly. I will eventually be faster if I keep practicing. 

**Link to work:** [Circuits.java](https://github.com/sharubhat/piij-cci/blob/master/src/main/java/com/piij/cci/topcoder/graphs/dfs/Circuits.java)

### Day 2: Jan 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved Topcoder porblem on [PathFinding](http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemDetail&rd=4585&pm=1110)

**Thoughts:** Struggled a lot debugging because I ignored one of the most important requirement which was not to place the player on walls. Need to stay more focussed while reading the problem. Also, I need to start writing junit tests for the problems that have been solved already.

### Day 3: Jan 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried solving Topcoder porblem on [Escape](https://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemDetail&rd=4371&pm=1170). 2 out of 86 test cases are failing. Will try fixing it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Problem seemed easy on the first read but ended up misunderstanding the requirement and struggling quite a bit. Have spent over 3 hours on this one. Eventually fixing most of the issues caused by misunderstanding. There is no solution available on TC to compare, so decided to run all available test cases. 2/86 are failing. It's not going to be easy debugging. Will be resuming tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Will check in tomorrow if I manage to fix the code.

### Day 4: Jan 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Escape](https://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemDetail&rd=4371&pm=1170). All test cases are now passing. Moving on to next problem.

**Thoughts:** Need to solve more graph problems to get better at them.

### Day 5: Jan 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Trying to solve Dijkstra's problems from topcoder. Couldn't comeplte.

**Thoughts:** Simple concept but finding it very hard to understand and then translate understanding to code.

**Link to work:** Nothing yet.

### Day 6: Jan 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved [RoboCourier](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemDetail&rd=4555&pm=1749) using Dijkstra's shortest path technique. Also solved [TeamBuilder](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemDetail&rd=4740&pm=2356) based on Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

**Thoughts:** It's important to visualise the graph before attempting to solve the problem. This problem is tricky in terms of movement that robot can make within the grid. 

**Link to work:** [RoboCourier.java](https://github.com/sharubhat/piij-cci/blob/master/src/main/java/com/piij/cci/topcoder/graphs/dijkstra/robocourier/RoboCourier.java), 
[TeamBuilder.java](https://github.com/sharubhat/piij-cci/blob/master/src/main/java/com/piij/cci/topcoder/graphs/floyd/warshall/TeamBuilder.java)

### Day 7: Jan 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly learning, not much coding.

### Day 8: Jan 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt minimum spanning trees. I need to get back to graphs after a few days.

### Day 9: Jan 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Brushing up java 8 features - mostly lambda expressions and functions.

**Thoughts:** Feels like refreshing Scala :) 

### Day 10: Jan 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with java8 Streams.

### Day 11: Feb 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Missed updating for several days. Working through Coursera course on Machine Learning.

### Day 12: Feb 22, 2007

**Today's Progress**: Started with MOOC Learning From Data. 

**Thoughts:** It appears to be more suitable for beginner like me than Coursera course which is a bit more technical. Will be reviewing each chapter at least once after first watch.
