# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Solved Topcoder porblem on [Circuits](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1593&rd=4494)

**Thoughts:** I should not be stressing myself to get a solution quickly. Aim is to understand both the problem and the concept correctly. I will eventually be faster if I keep practicing.

### Day 2: Jan 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved Topcoder porblem on [PathFinding](http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemDetail&rd=4585&pm=1110)

**Thoughts:** Struggled a lot debugging because I ignored one of the most important requirement which was not to place the player on walls. Need to stay more focussed while reading the problem. Also, I need to start writing junit tests for the problems that have been solved already.
