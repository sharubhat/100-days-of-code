# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Solved Topcoder porblem on [Circuits](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1593&rd=4494)

**Thoughts:** I should not be stressing myself to get a solution quickly. Aim is to understand both the problem and the concept correctly. I will eventually be faster if I keep practicing.
